# Mind-Scan

## Goal
To create a script to automate the creation of Mobium Mind Scans.

## To run the notebook
Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. The easiest way to do this is to install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) which will install all dependencies along with JN. Once this is installed, open Jupyter Notebooks by going to your command prompt terminal and typing:

`$ jupyter notebook`

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser. You can then navigate to this repo, select the notebook, and run cells.
